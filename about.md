Hello, I am Vinit. I work at this awesome Dutch company, [Changer](http://changer.nl). I work as a developer on our array of web products. 
Quite recently, i have been working on our product [Socialschools](http://socialschools.nl).

In startups, you get to work on lot of interesting technologies. I have mostly self taught myself Python, C/C++, Linux and JavaScript. I love dabbling with good code and frameworks. Nodejs, Django and AngularJS are my recent obsession. I love hacking on them and creating apps.

I also enjoy doing Maths and Physics and have some interest in Economics, Chess. I keenly follow a variety of sports including Chess, Formala One and Tennis.
