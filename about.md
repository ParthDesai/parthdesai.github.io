I am highly motivated, self driven web developer with skills in technologies such as Python, Django, JavaScript, Ruby, Postgresql, MongoDB, Node.js, Git among others.

I favour standards based development and follow a disciplined approach to programming. I take pride and ownership in the products I work. I constantly work hard on upgrading my skills and knowledge in my area of expertise. I try to be platform/Language/framework agnostic due to which I am able to pick up technologies pretty quickly and get productive in short time. 

I am owner of a popular Tech blog (http://www.gotchacode.com/) and write mostly on programming, OSS and Software Developement.

I currently work at an awesome Dutch company [Changer](http://changer.nl) and my job involves building Safe and
Secure Social Network for School kids : [Socialschools](http://www.socialschools.nl/en/). 


I spend a good amount of time reading code and contributing to OSS. Lately, I have also being reading some good books on 
programming and Computer Science.

Some of the books I completed and I am currently reading are:

- The Art of Readable Code (completed)
- JavaScript: The Good Parts (completed)
- High performance JavaScript (completed)
- Learning Node (some chapters remaining)
- JavaScript, The Definitive Guide (some chapters remaining)
- SICP(2nd chapter)
- TAOCP (Volume 1 first chapter)
- Hacking Happy (completed)
- MongoDB, The definitive guide ( half completed)

I also enjoy doing some functional programming and study algorithms in my free time. Though, a lot of my current work is related to Python/JavaScript I do enjoy Low level programming and learning about the OS layer and Networking Layer.
