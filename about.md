## About 

I am Vinit and I am a JavaScript/nodejs/Python developer with an awesome Dutch company known as [Changer](http://changer.nl).

I contribute a lot to open source and love writing code. I love good coffee, good food and a peaceful life. I am a big fan of classical rock and british rock bands.I write my code on Vim(some ST2 too). Here is more about my setup [here](http://vinitkumar.me/articles/my-setup/).

I also maintain another popular technology blog named as [Gotchacode](http://www.gotchacode.com). I am sure you would love to read some of them.
