## About Parth

I have passion for algorithms and data structures.  I enjoy solving programming puzzles in my free time. I am passionate about writing software that scalable and reliable.  I spend a great amount of time improving my skills as a programmer. 

My programming style is to make the smallest change necessary to achieve desired goal. So I always build complex application modular and generic. And I keep only the most successful work flows and refactor/delete code as part of each change and keep the clever stuff behind the curtain of the clean interface.

In the past few years, I've worked as backend software engineer and/or architect, and designed complex backend solution in [c#](https://github.com/parthdesai/sso) and [golang](https://github.com/bulletind/khabar). 

Currently, I am working on developing pseudo real-time integrations with popular web sites, that enables our product to be integrated seamlessly with these sites(Github, stackexchange, twitter etc.). I am also doing technical review for renowned publisher in the UK for upcoming go programming language book.

I also work on c/c++ and haskell when I am not hiding behind my office computer.
