An experience and sensible web developer with good exposure with JavaScript and Python based development. I invest a lot of thinking and effort in the products I work on, which results in good user experience and user interaction for the product.

I have written both front-end and backend layers in past, so over the time have acquired a good understanding of building end to end solutions.

Quality programming, maintainable code and automation - These are three things I have high regards for. I play a lot with tooling to make development more productive. I don't use IDE's for programming and could do everything with my Editor (VIM).

In my free time, I love reading books (mostly computer science) or contributing to OSS.

I currently work at an awesome Dutch company
[Changer](http://changer.nl) and my job involves building Safe and
Secure Social Network for School kids : [Socialschools](http://www.socialschools.nl/en/). 

Lead Developer on these projects:

- GoogleCL - Google on command line

- ldb.js - LocalStorage abstraction library.
- Simple - Clean theme for Jekyll.
