I have passion for algorithms and data structures.  I enjoy solving programming puzzles in my free time. I am passionate about writing software that scalable and reliable.  I spend a great amount of time improving my skills as a programmer. 

In the past few years, I've worked as backend software engineer and/or architect, and designed complex backend solution in [c#](https://github.com/parthdesai/sso) and [golang](https://github.com/bulletind/khabar). 

Currently, I am working on developing pseudo real-time integrations with popular web sites, that enables our product to be integrated seamlessly with these sites(Github, stackexchange, twitter etc.). I am also doing technical review for renowned publisher in the UK for upcoming go programming language book.

I also work on c/c++ and haskell when I am not hiding behind my office computer.
