Hello, I am Vinit and I work as a JavaScipt/Node.JS programmer in an awesome Dutch company named as [Changer](http://changer.nl)

I fell in love with programming the first time i laid my hands on those sweet black and white computers(P2/P3) with LOGO in it. I progressed from Logo to GWBasic to Java to Python, C, C++ and now i mostly do JavaScript. I love how programming and development has progressed and continues to go beyond.

I like writing and meeting interesting people. I also used to do some sketching and drawing.

In here, you would mostly find my personal experiences, thoughts or some details about any of my open source projects. I believe in improving myself and working hard everyday.

I also maintain another popular technology Blog named as [Gotchacode](http://www.gotchacode.com). I am sure you would love to read some of them. So, what you waiting for? Grab some coffee and Enjoy them.
