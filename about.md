I have passion for algorithms and data structures. I enjoy solving programming puzzles in my free time. A Software Engineer who is passionate about writing software that scalable and reliable. I spend a great amount of time improving my skills as a programmer.

I am good with learning new skills and applying them to ongoing projects. I am a self learner and will never give up on an interesting technical challenge.

In the past few years, I've worked as backend software engineer and/or architect, and designed complex backend solution in c# and golang. I also do c/c++ and haskell when I am not hiding behind my office computer.
