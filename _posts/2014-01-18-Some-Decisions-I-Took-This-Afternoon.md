## How to be focussed:
- Concentrate only on the work at hand, with all your abilties.
- Don't give up when facing difficulty. Revisit it with a fresh perspective.


## How do I improve my knowledge?

- The only way is to use your abilities to learn something thoroughly.
- Say, If it's python. Read and understand everything that is to know about Python and the Eco-System.
- Think about how to write things in a better and more managable code.
- So self code review, write a system to do code review.


How to stop wastage of time:
- Don't check facebook, likedin and twitter at work or while coding at home.
- Keep a track of your time usage using toggl maybe.


# Tools:
- Fairly good at Vim.
- Removed Sublime Text2. Complete switch to Macvim and Vim again :)
- Take a small topic and read it completely end to end. Make notes of it. Use it. 
- Improve your projects by removing smell from your code.
- Your your imagination, take risks, experiments, hack but always keep backups.
- Automate things. Reduce clutter.
