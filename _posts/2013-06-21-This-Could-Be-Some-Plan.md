I just read a blog by Jeff Adwood that there are no Rockstar Programmers, there are people who could write cleaner code, refactort fast etc. faster than other people. 

Well, here is something that i should do:

- Read Madhu's code (reading better programmer's code.
- Write about code here.
- Think about data structure and algorithms.
- Create applications and use good API's.
- Learn how to create such good API's/.
- Improve your CSS(urgent).
- Do more testing(Frontend)

.. to be continued.
