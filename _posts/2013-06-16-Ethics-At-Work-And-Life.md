Work has a really important part in anyone's life.These are some of the things i feel is very important part of one's professional ethos.


- Arrive on time.
- Think logically before you make any decision.
- Keep the communication lines open.
- You are facing a difficulty admit it, don't let your ego come in between.
- There are always things that could be difficult, persistent hard work is the only way to crack them.
- Don't fall victim of easy goals, work with full passion whatever you have decided.
- Don't think much about other things, just concentrate on your work. 


##Most important things:

- No work is a small work or less important, everything teaches you something new.
- Life to too small to waste on less important things.
- Keep your mouth shut when you don't have something useful to contribute.
- Read books, improve your skill.
- Challenge your limits.
- Read well, write well.
