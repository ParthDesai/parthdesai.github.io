There are lots of things that have changed in recent past. I have changed from a hardcore Linux user to a Mac lover. I got a high end Macbook pro with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD. It is just a pleasure to work on. Also, i could carry my mac home to that i could even work on the personal open source projects i work on. Well, i kinda really like my mac. There are many reasons for it.

- The OS X is quite good and amazingly stable.
- UI and UX is quite good once you get used to it.
- Almost every applications and tools under the sun is available to you.
- No messing up with hardwares, just connect and play.
- Awesome battery life, i could easily get 8 hours battery backup with this sweet machine.
- 13-inch is an awesome form factor.


Also, i recently got myself a HTC Desire X Android Smartphone. It is a lovely piece of hardware. Not big or bulky. At 4-inch screen i have enough screen estate to do whatever i can do. Camera is good as well. All together i am quite satisified with my phone. Did i mention Beats Audio? It is an excellent addition to my phone. I spend quite some time travelling to office and it seems to be a great feeling to listen to music while travelling.


Though i still love my 2 year old dell and Nokia E5. Some repair and polishing is required and i will sure give them their due in right time.

I love my hardware and doesn't everyone else does too.
