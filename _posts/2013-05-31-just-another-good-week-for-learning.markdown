This week is going to be a particularly good one. I am implementing 
twitter clone in node.js. It is a  great exercise to just take a look 
at something trying to guess what is going on behind the scenes and 
reverse engineering it in a different stack.

Well , the basis of attempting this is that a lot of rails devs are 
shifting to node and a lot of design architecture in node is being 
borrowed from rails. Say "Fat models, thin controllers."

I will be posting about some special code segments and problems how 
i tackled them in future post. 

Going to sleep now. Ciao!
