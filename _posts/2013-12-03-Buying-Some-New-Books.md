# Buying New Computer Science Books

In the span of two days I have ordered three books:

- The Art of Computer Programming (Volume 1, 2 and 3)
- SICP
- The Art of Readable code

There are one of the best books on the subject and I am waiting eagerly
to lay my hands on them. I will also need to brush up my mathematics
quite well now since a lot of part in these books are purely
mathematical. 

Well, AOCP is considered the toughest book to understand so my plan is
to keep reading it slowly and steadily. But i would like to complete
TARC and SICP in the coming 6 months.

For solving the exercise in SICP, I would use Clojure since it is the
new hotness and runs on JVM. For TARC, I would be using my main
programming language I code at work and work( Python and JavaScript).


I hope the coming months to be exciting and informative. It is said that
some decisions impact your life in a great manner and I would like this
to be one of them.
