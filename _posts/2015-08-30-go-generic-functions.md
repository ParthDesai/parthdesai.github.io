Overview
========
Starting from golang 1.1, it offers reflection support to do almost anything dynamically. Combine that with functional programming support, and you can write generic functions in no time.

In this article, I will describe how to write generic functions in golang, as well as pros and cons of the same.

Functional Programming in Golang
--------------------------------
Golang supports first class functions, higher-order functions, user-defined function types, function literals, closures, and multiple return values. 

For scope of this article, I will demonstrate three of above features: function literals, function types and higher order functions.

In this example, we implemented `filterArray` function, that takes two arguments, array of integer and a function. And filter the array using the function passed.

As you can see, we call `filterArray` function, two times with different function literal, first literal filters out odd numbers, while second removes even numbers.

But, this is not enough to write truly generic code, as you can see, we can only pass integer array and only functions who are compatible with function type that we declared beforehand. 

Enter reflection!!

Reflection in Golang 
--------------------
Unlike C/C++, in golang every object retains associated type information, even if it is assigned to a `interface` variable. This plays key part, while using reflection.

Reflection apis are exposed in golang, through built-in package called `reflect`.

Official `reflect` package documentation: [Reflect Documentation](http://golang.org/pkg/reflect/)

There are two central concepts, in context of `reflect` package which we need to understand before diving into the code:

* `Type`: It is an Object that represent go types as well as user defined types. For example: `int`, `string`, `map`, `func`.

* `Value`: It is an Object, which encapsulates and act as an interface to the underlying Go Object. It is useful when we want to do some common operation on the object of particular kind (i.e array or map).

With help of reflection and functional programming, we can write a generic function in go, with run-time safety.

By run time type safety, I mean that the types of a functionâ€™s arguments are consistent with semantics of function or else the function predictably fails at run time with a reasonable error message.

As you can see in this example, we have used `Value`, and `Type` cleverly, to check if input parameters confirms the semantics of mapping, and to construct output argument.

Word of Caution
---------------
There are certain situation where we should avoid generic function:

* Where speed is prime concern: Generic functions are slow. For example `map` function in previous example, is quite slower than its static counterpart. 

* Where compile time safety is requird: As you can see, the function we have written accepts anything for its parameters, thanks to `interface{}` type. This makes it very flexible to use this function for different data types. But, that also mean that now the compiler, cannot point out error at compile time. So for large generic program, we must rely on extensive testing to make sure, it works properly.
