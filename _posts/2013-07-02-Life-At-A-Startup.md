These few months has been really exciting for me. I joined Changer on Feb 1, 2013
so officially i completed 5 amazing months here.

Well, here are some of key-points that i think working in a startup is like for me:

- You should try to learn and own the stack you are working on. Trying to be good at a lot of things is not going to help.
- Look for a company which has Open Source as one of core values.If not try to 
bring that culture in the company.
- Write a lot of code and read a lot more. Invest time in learning and understanding your product. 
- Think about code quality and maintainability before you write a single line of code.These are tough things to get it right, but with time and open source projects you could get it right.
- Have good understanding and relationship with the people you daily work with.
Always have a smile on your face.
- Have fun with what you do. Period!
