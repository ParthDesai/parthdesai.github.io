I have been using vim for almost 5 years now. For a brief time i even
switched to Sublime text2 but I am finally back to home. Well, the
following guide is only for macs. Sorry GVIM users, i no longer use
Linux so I am not very sure about how these plugins will behave or even
work. I am sure some of them are only meant for macs.

Here is the latest screenshot of my macvim:

As you can see, it has a nice Filebrowser that is way more clean and
intuitive than NERDTree and is pretty. Also there is a very clean file
navigation using `\-p`.  

Follow these instructions to have the same in your Mac.


First of all do this:

```sh
$ mkdir .vim
$ git clone git@github.com:vinitkumar/.vim.git
```

Copy all the vimrc file from the repo to the home and then install the
peepopen app from here: [Peepopen](http://topfunky.github.io/PeepOpen/)

Once you are done with these steps you have a super awesome development
IDE optimised for Python/JS/Ruby development.


Happy hacking!
