#My Setup

I am doing The Setup interview for myself. It is basically based on these four questions:

- Who are you and what do you do?
- What hardware do you use?
- And what software?
- What would be your dream setup?

So here it goes:

### Who are you and what do you do?

Hey, I am Vinit and I am a software developer at this awesome dutch startup,[Changer](http://changer.nl). I mostly write code in JavaScript and Python. 

### What hardware do you use?

I use a Macbook Pro, Mid 2009, with 8 GB Ram and 256 GB SSD. I use a apple wired keyboard, BenQ Monitors at work. I use Logitech GT400 mouse at work and home. I recently bought a 512 GB WD hard disk.

I also have an old Dell Inspiron Laptop which has Linux and Windows 7. My phone is HTC Desire X with runs Android Jelly Bean.
I use SteelSeries Siberia Headphones and htc earphones for listening to music.

### And What Software?

I use OS X as my primary operating system.  
Well here is the list of Software i use:

- OS: OS X, Android, Windows, Linux
- Browsers: Chrome(canary), Firefox
- TextEditor: Vim, SublimeText2, TextMate.
- Music and Video : iTunes, QuickTime, Miro and VLC.
- Terminal: iTerm2
- Todo List: Evernote
- Backup: Google Drive, Dropbox.

On Android, I use Google now, Aldiko, Google Keep, Maps, Instagram, Twitter, Dropbox, Evernote mostly.

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup would be couple of Big 30-inch monitors and a better flat keyboard, also a really good pair of Noise canceling headphones.
I mostly like minimalistic setup so i guess that would do.
