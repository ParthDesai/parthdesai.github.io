I joined Changer in Feb 2013. This Feb I completed my one year at my first full time employment. It has been a roller coaster ride for me.
Very very exciting time spent and much more to come.

First year in any company is your toughest. It is so hard to adjust working with people, communicating properly, keep your mind sane
in lows and highs.

Last year I took very few holidays, naturally spent the time at Office working on some project and hacking on one of my own open source projects.

I am very proud of the hard work I did last year and of the contributions I made in the projects I worked on. Obviously I did some novice mistakes
here and there, but I am totally committed to try harder and do things right in the first time.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my parents, my girlfriend and my colleagues for being super supportive and nice during this time. 
I promise, I will make everyone very proud soon. :)
