  <p>Hello, I am Vinit. I am a Web Developer in this awesome Dutch company Changer(http://changer.nl).</p>
  <p>I am passionate about creating clean, useful softwares that serves a purpose or
  solves an interesting problem.</p>
  <p>At my Company, I am helping build a Safe and Secure Social Network for School Children.
  You can check out our website to know us a little better (http://socialschools.nl).
  I feel everything in life has a purpose. At my work, I am working with a
  team of passionate geeks to build a very safe and secure Social Network
  for Kids. [SocialSchools](http://socialschools.nl). We ensure that there
  is a safe and secure line of communication stays open between parents,
  teacher and students. This is very important because of two very
  important reasons. 
  <ul>
    <li>Children are our future and if we could help them grow safely and
      understand the true meaning and use of technology they would grow into
      mature and responsible citizens.
    </li>  -
    <li>Also, we had make sure that unlike other Social Networks your data and
      information doesn't float around in internet and cause you agony. 
    </li
  </ul>
